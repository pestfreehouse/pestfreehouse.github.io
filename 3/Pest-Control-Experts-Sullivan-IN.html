<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The revival of bed bugs has actually caused more than the creepy little blood suckers to come out of the woodwork. We look at the huge photo and concentrate on long term avoidance of pests by carrying out pre-treatment assessments, recognizing conditions conducive to pests, de-webbing, positioning of keeping an eye on devices, sanitation recommendations, prevention & exemption, and applying pesticides in a tactical and safe way are all examples of how Mills PM executes the practices of IPM.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest determination consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
