<p>More info is needed about food-chain concentration and practical ways of eliminating detrimental results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their function.

Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae ruin berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
