<p>More info is needed about food-chain concentration and practical ways of eliminating detrimental results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their function. Do not base pest management programs on overall elimination of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae ruin berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>

If a lot of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides should be utilized as the last option, in concept, in some cases they are the very first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of particular endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to protect the seed and transplants from typical and persistent pest problems.</p>
