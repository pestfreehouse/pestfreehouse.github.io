The majority of insecticides fall under the chemical classification since they are generally more effective and can typically be used to control a number of pests. Physical barriers such as fences, nets, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and minimize the damage they cause.</p>
<p>The number of plants inspected will depend on aspects such as the value of the crop, potential problems and size and type of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines various types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to conventional artificial pesticides-- in a sensible, long-term plan. Biopesticides are generally compatible with natural opponents, but there are exceptions.</p>
