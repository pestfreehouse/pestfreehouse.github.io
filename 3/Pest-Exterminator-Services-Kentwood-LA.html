<p>Socio-psychological factors including logical and moral considerations were discovered to the motorists in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of certified IPM professionals and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so unbearable sometimes that the only choice left is to employ a local pest control company to get rid of pests. The professional will typically spray pesticides around the perimeter of different rooms if a professional pest control company is under agreement to an institution. Therefore, incorporated pest management suggests that areawide and long-term approaches can be important.</p>
<p>National Pesticide Details Center: Provides unbiased, science-based details about pesticides to allow people to make informed choices about pesticides use. Mix pesticides according to label guidelines. Waage (39) recommends that biopesticides could form the methadone of IPM," helping agroecosystems to recuperate from the routine of calendar spraying while we are revamping and nurturing them to a more self-renewing capability.</p>
