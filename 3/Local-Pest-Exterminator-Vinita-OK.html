Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically solely about reducing pesticide usage.

With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure. Current quests for effective, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily towards advancement of new and much better products with which to replace conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
