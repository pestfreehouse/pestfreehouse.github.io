D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is searched, record arthropod pest numbers, area within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants examined. It's possible that the repeated use of pesticides may be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these thresholds adjust for changes in market value, stage of crop development, cost of pesticides, and so on, however in reality most are based on fixed invasion or damage levels.</p>
