<p>We historically have offered nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the efficiency of environmentally unsound techniques in addition to its array of fundamental strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds.

Another technique includes using baits that either destroy the pests or prevent them from replicating.
