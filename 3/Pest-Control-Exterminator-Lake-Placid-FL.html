<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are devoted to providing the best possible service to safeguard versus undesirable pests. The copying describes the six parts of an Integrated Pest Management program utilized to handle carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-term pest prevention, an effective IPM program uses a combination of control techniques consisting of biological control, habitat control, changes to cultural practices and use of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>The human response depends upon the value of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to entirely remove the pest. Recent experiences with insect pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for crucial examples in the discussion. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and prevention programs that count on several simultaneous techniques to get the desired result.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and identify them precisely, so that appropriate control decisions can be made in conjunction with action limits. However, the major trend has been towards making use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to change standard pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; however these means are still therapeutics.</p>
