Managing pests can be performed in many methods but an effective way is to clean out the bugs frequently. In this guide we define chemical or traditional insecticides as those having a broad spectrum of activity and being more damaging to natural enemies.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are categorized into various groups based upon their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and turning chemicals from various mode of action groups is suggested to minimize the threat of resistance development (Triggers and Nauen 2015 ). Government policies limit the time and amount of particular chemical pesticides and help mitigate the involved risks.</p>
<p>Using info about pests' biology and practices, along with a toolbox of pest management methods, pest control workers locate, recognize, and remove pests. But since these "sex" traps attract primarily male insects, they aren't extremely reliable controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest. A routine monitoring program is the basis of IPM choice making, regardless of the control strategies used.</p>
