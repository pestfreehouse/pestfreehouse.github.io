Focusing primarily on long-lasting pest prevention, a successful IPM program makes use of a mix of control approaches including biological control, environment manipulation, changes to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest reliable dose when other methods of pest control have actually failed.

Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
