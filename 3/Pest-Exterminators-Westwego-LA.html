<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very reliable in causing considerable reductions in pest populations in certain scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

<p>Consider alternative approaches (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Recent missions for effective, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly toward development of brand-new and much better items with which to replace traditional harmful pesticides.</p>
