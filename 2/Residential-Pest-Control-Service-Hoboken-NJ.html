This 15-hour self-study course is based upon the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique, as taught within Plantwise and our Masters in Integrated Crop Management. It requires a greater understanding of the pest, crop and the environment. In Jones, the plaintiffs were a husband and wife who had actually moved into a home on an Air Force base that had been sprayed by a pest control service with a pesticide containing chlordane.</p>

If a number of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides need to be utilized as the last hope, in concept, often they are the very first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of specific endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to safeguard the seed and transplants from typical and relentless pest problems.</p>

The pest control industry is just beginning to comprehend the chances to improve our business with social and mobile innovation-- however the possibilities are limitless.</p>
