<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control home insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about lowering pesticide use.

Therefore, it is vital that we put together proper groups to illuminate interactions at the community level to develop the knowledge base for environmentally based pest management systems.</p>
