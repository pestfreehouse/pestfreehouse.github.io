<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control home insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about lowering pesticide use.

<p>QualityPro is the industry-wide accreditation program of the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), which increases our level of professionalism through self-regulation. Obviously landscape ecology practices apply a variety of preferred or unwanted effects on cropping systems (27 ). Therefore, it is vital that we put together proper groups to illuminate interactions at the community level to develop the knowledge base for environmentally based pest management systems.</p>

Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making process wherein observations, including examination and monitoring, are used to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
