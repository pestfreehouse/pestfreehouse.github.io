<p>Their expert exterminators are available for 24 hr of emergency situation services for their important customers. However, the high potential for reproduction of insect pests stays, and a population explosion of many types can be expected from a low-density level whenever suitable ecological conditions occur or control slackens. Under this plan, insect control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>

For the past couple of years, pest management professionals have been utilizing birth control for pest birds such as pigeons as a way of handling populations.
