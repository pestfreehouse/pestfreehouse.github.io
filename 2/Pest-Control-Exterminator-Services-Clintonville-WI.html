<p>Termites are nasty customers. For some jobs, pest control employees use a combination of pest management methods, a practice called incorporated pest management. The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine inspections. Crop losses due to arthropods, diseases, and weeds, though disputed by some as a legitimate procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is hunted, record arthropod pest numbers, location within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants inspected. It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides might be more harmful in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these thresholds adjust for modifications in market value, stage of crop growth, cost of pesticides, etc., but in reality most are based on repaired invasion or damage levels.</p>
