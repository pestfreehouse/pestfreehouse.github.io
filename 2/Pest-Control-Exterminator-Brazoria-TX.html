<p>The new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence specific genes in the target pest is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Specific biostimulants based on minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stressors, but are applied as changes with no claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These brand-new products or innovations can fall under one or more abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
