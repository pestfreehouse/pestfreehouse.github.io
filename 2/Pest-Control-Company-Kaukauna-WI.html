<p>There are many farming practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all techniques. This chapter discusses different methods to keep pest insects at bearable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM). Keep pets and kids away from areas where pesticides have been used.</p>
<p>Consider alternative techniques (other than pesticides) to make your home and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Current quests for reliable, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly towards development of brand-new and better products with which to change standard harmful pesticides.</p>

Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
