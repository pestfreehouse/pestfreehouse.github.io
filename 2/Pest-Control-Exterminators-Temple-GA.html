We take a look at the huge picture and focus on long term avoidance of pests by performing pre-treatment assessments, identifying conditions favorable to pests, de-webbing, placement of keeping an eye on gadgets, sanitation suggestions, avoidance & exclusion, and using pesticides in a tactical and safe manner are all examples of how Mills PM carries out the practices of IPM.</p>

<p>Chemical pest control, particularly space fumigation, tends to work best for extreme infestations.

Our knowledgeable exterminators form a quick reaction group for both houses and services in Central Illinois, with the capability to either offer exceptional pest control - making your building unwelcoming for any pest - or targeted services developed to eliminate a single problem.</p>
