The term pest" refers to more than one reason for issues including illness, unfavorable insects, mites, mollusks, nematodes and weeds. A number of treatment methods have been used, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and toxic gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the materials, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, modified environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>A pest can be a plant (weed), vertebrate (bird, rodent, or other mammal), invertebrate (insect, tick, mite, or snail), nematode, pathogen (bacteria, infection, or fungus) that causes illness, or other undesirable organism that may harm water quality, animal life, or other parts of the ecosystem.

Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus professionals need to have -emphasizing the broader ecology of pest management and avoiding toxic chemicals unless there are no alternatives.</p>
