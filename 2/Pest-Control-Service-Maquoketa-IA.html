Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic method towards pest threat management by using proactive control techniques. Insecticides are categorized in a number of methods, and it is very important to be familiar with these categories so that the choice of an insecticide is based on more than merely how well it controls the pest.</p>
<p>Saved item pests are most likely to be in a food component on shipment to a processing factory or a processed foodstuff when saved for a long period of time. Using pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, despite requirement, is not IPM.
