Do not blend pesticides. There are four major components in the brand-new IPM design that deal with numerous pest management choices, the knowledge, and resources the grower has to resolve the pest concern, planning and organization of information to take suitable management actions, and keeping good communication to disseminate and obtain understanding about pests and their management.</p>
