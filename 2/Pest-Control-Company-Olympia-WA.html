Insecticides that stay toxic to pests for a very long time and stay on the treated surface area will have a comparable effect on natural opponents.</p>

<p>If pesticides are required, they are selected and applied in a manner that prevents interrupting other IPM practices. Practically every type of pest poses a risk to the homes they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
