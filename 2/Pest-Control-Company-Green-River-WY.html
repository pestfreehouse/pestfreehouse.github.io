<p>Termites are nasty clients. For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management strategies, a practice called incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to diseases, weeds, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>Recent research studies record the need for continued decreases in hazardous pesticide usage and practices. Although the fundamental parts of IPM are always the same, the particular aspects of an IPM program differ from one environment or situation to another.
