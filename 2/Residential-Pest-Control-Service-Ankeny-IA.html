Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about decreasing pesticide use.

<p>An extensive knowledge of general IPM concepts and various management choices for all possible pest problems is very important as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We normally advise pest control chemicals that finish the job using the least quantity of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option).

Sometimes, the term" biological control" has been utilized in a broad context to encompass a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based items including pheromones, resistant plant varieties, and autocidal techniques such as sterile insects.</p>
