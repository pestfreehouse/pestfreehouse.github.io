<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest efficient dose when other techniques of pest control have actually failed.

<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential component of an integrated pest management program.

Examples include cultivation of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, selection of planting websites, trap crops, and adjusting the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
