<h3>Pest Control Exterminator Ocean City MD 21842</h3>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as an entire and takes into account a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest perseverance consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>The best method to control pests is to make your home unattractive to them. But household pests can likewise be a risk to your family. When trying to find a place to infest, pests prefer to conceal in a location that supplies food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is much easier to carry out in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses many of the same principles as IPM however restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to minimize the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
