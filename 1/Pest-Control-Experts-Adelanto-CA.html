Non-synthetic or natural pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group. Risk for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (harmless or helpful) types that habituate in the orchards or fields. These pests are just anywhere and all over, be it homes, workplaces, companies, dining locations, hotels etc, anywhere which is not truly kept effectively and is not hygienic.</p>
