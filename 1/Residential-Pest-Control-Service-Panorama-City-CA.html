<p>Illness or pests can be present in a crop without triggering financial damage. Precision applications of low toxicity pesticides rather than common baseboard applications or treatment of a whole property also have actually shown to significantly reduce the total volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests often have natural opponents that are advantageous to the landscape.</p>
<p>Constant surveillance and tracking of insect pests population is important for evaluation of damage and for figuring out the requirements for actions to be taken. Chemical pest control is making use of pesticides to damage damaging insects ororganisms.
