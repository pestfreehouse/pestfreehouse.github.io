<p>Biological pest control steps make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs preliminary task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and dynamics of pests and natural enemies helps to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control professionals even repair structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
<p>Stay vigilant and contact your pest control professional for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop ranges often accidentally produce conditions which favor pest species (e.g., pest types which have tired deeper into bigger fruit making them unattainable to natural enemies).
