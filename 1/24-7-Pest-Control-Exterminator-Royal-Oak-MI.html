<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>Sun drying: Stored grain pests can be easily controlled by sun drying. Pest control experts or exterminators help remove undesirable visitors from locals, industrial structures, and other public areas such as mice, rats, roaches, bees, spiders, ticks, bed bugs, fleas, termites, as well as many other kinds of pests. Under IPM, actions are taken to control pests only when their numbers are most likely to surpass appropriate levels.</p>
