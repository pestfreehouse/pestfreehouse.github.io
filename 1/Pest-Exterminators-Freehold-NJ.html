Pesticides not contained in traps or baits must typically just be applied to targeted locations, not sprayed over the whole space. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach that involves the management of a pest instead of eradicating a pest or managing. TAP insulation for attics, wetness barriers for crawl spaces, and specifically crafted weather stripping for garage and entry doors not only discourage rodents and other devastating pests from entering and living in your home, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and yard care items are most effective when they are used appropriately. You can go with natural chemical treatments, with botanic or fermented items used to exterminate pests.
