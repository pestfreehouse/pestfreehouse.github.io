<p>If pesticides are essential, they are selected and used in a way that prevents disrupting other IPM practices. Almost every kind of pest poses a hazard to the homes they populate, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and identify them precisely, so that suitable control decisions can be made in conjunction with action limits. However, the significant pattern has actually been toward the use of modern chemistry and molecular biology to replace traditional pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; however these ways are still rehabs.</p>
