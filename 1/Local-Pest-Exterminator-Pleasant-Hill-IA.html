<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as an entire and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>Tracking and identification decreases the dangers of using the incorrect kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other methods will be more effective. The benefit of the misting pest control approach is that it's thought about to be environmentally friendly, it's odorless and does not leave any residues that are challenging to be cleaned. Cultural practices - depend on a strategy to make the crop or environment unacceptable to pests by interfering with their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or area by both adults and immatures.</p>
