<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of rational and ethical factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that an absence of certified IPM experts and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM application in developed countries.</p>
