<p>The human reaction depends on the value of the damage done, and will vary from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to totally remove the pest.

The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to pest control and prevention programs that rely on a number of synchronised methods to obtain the preferred outcome.</p>
<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply chosen biopesticides with low ecological impact. Professional exterminators use different types of baits and pesticides to kill and get rid of pests. Reliable, long-term corrective actions can then be required to prevent pests from entering the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
<p>The techniques often involve the use of extreme chemicals to eliminate the undesirable pests. All available techniques of insect-pest management and control should be thought about. Ecological influences like dry spell stress influences pest management recommendations. This handbook becomes part of a training course on Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
