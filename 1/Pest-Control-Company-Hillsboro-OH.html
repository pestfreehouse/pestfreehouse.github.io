Besides routine external spraying, whenever there was thought to be a threat of a pest issue developing, there was no documented or regular pest control program at MTSL at the time of the preliminary audit.</p>
<p>The determination of the correct cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides toxic to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life stages.</p>
<p>If pesticides are essential, they are picked and applied in a manner that prevents interrupting other IPM practices. Nearly every kind of pest poses a risk to the homes they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
