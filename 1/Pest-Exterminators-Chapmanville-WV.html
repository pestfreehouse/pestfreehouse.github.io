<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>Some likewise recognized that if regionally coordinated IPM might happen, even annual management of a consistent pest might be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We recruit exterminators who specialize in commercial or commercial pest control. Constant training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for facility of efficient and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
